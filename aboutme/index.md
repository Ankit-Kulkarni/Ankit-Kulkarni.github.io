 **" I code becuase I love to, not because I have to "**

Hi I am Ankit Kulkarni . 

I am a **Devops Engineer** (who inherently loves automation and linux), loves open source and above all I strongly believe in the philosophy - **"get your code shipped "** ( [ more at coding horror](https://blog.codinghorror.com/version-1-sucks-but-ship-it-anyway/) ) .

I enjoy reading books, scripting/building simple tools for solving some real simple problems . 

I am currently living at [Banglore, India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore) and working in [Flock](https://flock.com/in/)([Directi](https://www.directi.com/)). Before Flock, I was freelancing for 1-2 months and before that I was working at [Zaya Learning Labs](http://www.zaya.in/). I completed my post-grad(M.C.A) from [IIPS-DAVV](http://iips.edu.in/), Indore, India. Before zaya I worked at [TinyOwl](http://www.tinyowl.com/)(where I started my career) as a DevOps Engineer.

I love to explore new technologies, tools, reading books/blogs(mostly about startups and tech ), trying out small and simple hacks. Now a days I am spending most of my time working on building a reliable,efficient and scalable mailing infrastructure [@Flock](https://flock.com/mail/). I spend most of my time at my workplace doing some pesky stuff(with [python](https://www.python.org/) and [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) mostly) or some R&D or refactoring my own code.  I also love to help/mentor people. When not playing with systems I can be found reading or near my bed(sleeping :p) .

**What I don't like is to mess/code with frontend (HTML/CSS/JS ---eww so scary, still I end up messing with it everytime )**

I have been  a great fan of [blogging]() but honestly too lazy to maintain my own blog . I hope I could make it active sooner on [medium @ankit.kulkarni](https://medium.com/@ankit.kulkarni) . I am also soon planning to share my reading list of curated articles(now can be found [here](https://i.ankul.in/readlist/) -  and [books @goodread](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44478379-ankit-kulkarni).

**PS**: BTW here's a an interesting take away since you landed here - [BOFH reading list ](http://www.theregister.co.uk/data_centre/bofh/)  ( if you are into love with systems you will enjoy reading it)
