 **" I code becuase I love to, not because I have to "**

Hi I am Ankit Kulkarni . 

At core I am an **Engineer** (who inherently loves automation and linux), loves open source and above all I strongly believe in the philosophy - **"get your code shipped "** ( [ more at coding horror](https://blog.codinghorror.com/version-1-sucks-but-ship-it-anyway/) ) .

I enjoy reading books, scripting/building simple tools for solving some real simple problems . I have read many books out of which my favorites are power of habbit, the Effective Engineer ,Rework, Checklist Manifesto and Don't make me think(steve krug) and few more. 

I am currently living at [Banglore, India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore) and working in [Flock](https://flock.com/in/)/[Titan](https://titan.email/)/[Neo Mail](https://www.neo.space/)/([Directi](https://www.directi.com/)). Before Titan, I was freelancing for 1-2 months and before that I was working at [Zaya Learning Labs](http://www.zaya.in/).Before zaya I worked at [TinyOwl](http://www.tinyowl.com/)(where I started my career) as a DevOps Engineer. 

I completed my post-grad(M.C.A) from [IIPS-DAVV](http://iips.edu.in/), Indore, India. 

I love to explore new technologies, tools, reading books/blogs(mostly about startups and tech ), trying out small and simple hacks. Now a days I am spending most of my time working on building a reliable,efficient and scalable mailing infrastructure [@TitanMail](https://titan.email/).I often spend my time building mailing softwares using golang and debugging problems of mailing infra . I am also actively leading the abuse mititagation initiatives  which is one of the hardest problems from the industry. 

Though as an engineer I love building softwares however at the same time I am obssesed with customer experience. I am a power user for few softwares and love them from heart and thus I love building products with high usability, utter simplicity and brainless designs(put less conginitive load). Head out to know more on what I think on [how to build produts as engineers](https://medium.com/@ankit.kulkarni/engineering-a-product-is-easy-building-it-is-a-different-story-2a48fd0e9fd8)

Large part of my career has been spent at Flock/Titan where I joined as Sr. Devops Engineer in 2018 and had spent close to 5 years as IC writing softwares. From 2023 I am working as Lead Devops where much of my time goes into figuring out hard problems of the business and get them prioritized and solved. As programing language I work with go/python/shell. 

When not playing with systems I can be found reading or near my bed(sleeping :p) 

**What I don't like is to mess/code with frontend (HTML/CSS/JS ---eww so scary, still I end up messing with it everytime )**

I have been  a great fan of [blogging]() but honestly too lazy to maintain my own blog . I hope I could make it active sooner on [medium @ankit.kulkarni](https://medium.com/@ankit.kulkarni) . I also have a recommeded reading list (not regularly updated here though) which can be found [here](https://i.ankul.in/readlist/) -  and [books @goodread](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44478379-ankit-kulkarni).

**PS**: BTW here's a an interesting take away since you landed here - [BOFH reading list ](http://www.theregister.co.uk/data_centre/bofh/)  ( if you are into love with systems you will enjoy reading it)
