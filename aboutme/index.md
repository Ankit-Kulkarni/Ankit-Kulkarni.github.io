 **" I code becuase I love to, not because I have too "**

Hi I am Ankit Kulkarni . 

I am a **Devops Engineer** (who inherently loves automation and linux), loves open source and above all I strongly belive on philosophy - **"get your code shipped "** ( [ more at codding horror](https://blog.codinghorror.com/version-1-sucks-but-ship-it-anyway/) ) .

I enjoy scripting/building simple tools for solving some real simple problems . 

I currently live at [Mumbai, India](https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Mumbai,+Maharashtra/@19.082688,72.600998,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x3be7c6306644edc1:0x5da4ed8f8d648c69!8m2!3d19.0759837!4d72.8776559) and work at [Zaya Learning Labs](http://www.zaya.in/) . I completed my post-grad(M.C.A) from [IIPS-DAVV](http://iips.edu.in/), Indore, India  . Before zaya I worked at [TinyOwl](http://www.tinyowl.com/) as a DevOps Engineer

I love to explore new technologies, tools, reading blogs(mostly about startups and tech ), trying out small and simple hacks. I spend most of my time at my workplace doing some pesky stuff(with [python](https://www.python.org/) and [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) mostly) or some R&D or refactoring my own code.I also love to help/mentor people. When not playing with systems I can be found near my bed(sleeping :p) .

**What I don't like is to mess/code with frontend (HTML/CSS/JS ---eww so scarry, still I end up messing with it everytime )**

I have been  a great fan of [blogging]() but honestly too lazy to maintain my own blog . I hope I could make it active some day(sooner) . 

**PS**: In the meantime I am also trying to make habbit of regular reading of books. BTW here's a takeaway for the readers - [BOFH reading list ](http://www.theregister.co.uk/data_centre/bofh/)  ( if you are into love with systems you will enjoy reading it)
