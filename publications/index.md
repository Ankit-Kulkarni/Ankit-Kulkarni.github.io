* **Text Recognition in an Image Using Statistical Method- (PaperID: 535) in [ICICIS 2012](http://www.icicis2012.org/)**:Nowadays content-based retrieval is pivotal issue in design of multimedia systems, which requires pattern matching and human cognition process. Literature survey revealed that huge scope is available to work in the area of text information retrieval from image files. Due to varying pattern in the image size, shape and orientations of text in images, it is computationally difficult to extract information from image files. The work is based on the Image Processing techniques and cognitive graphics. In this work a black and white image is pre-processed through the image processing techniques, and later will be matched with the standard available structures. We applied statistical algorithms to identify and extract the individual letters and numbers.
